# Code of Conduct

Welcome to my Personal Project - ClockWise, a proposed DTR and Leave Management System.

This space represents my professional work and knowledge in Software Development and QA Testing. All interactions here should remain respectful, professional, and constructive. It also serves as a living record of my ongoing journey in mastering CI/CD pipelines, Dockerized environments, accessibility compliance, and advanced QA automation. Future updates will highlight my progress in integrating GitHub Actions, structured testing workflows, and evolving best practices in software engineering, ensuring that this project reflects both my current expertise and my commitment to continuous learning.

All interactions here should remain respectful, professional, and constructive.

## Principles
- Communicate with respect and courtesy.  
- Provide feedback that is helpful and relevant.  
- Avoid discriminatory or offensive behavior.

## Continuous Learning & Future Plans
This project is not only a reflection of my current skills but also a platform for growth. I plan to expand my knowledge and apply best practices in areas such as:
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- Dockerized environments for consistent development and production workflows.
- Accessibility compliance through structured WCAG/ARIA testing.
- Advanced QA automation using Python OOP and Playwright.
